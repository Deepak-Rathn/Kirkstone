/* One type of 1905 CMDUs embeds "M1" and "M2" messages from the "Wi-Fi simple
*  configuration standard".
*
*  Because building these "M1" and "M2" messages in completely independent from
*  the 1905 standard, I have created this simple interface to isolate the
*  process as much as possible.
*
*  It works like this:
*
*    * ENROLLEE:
*
*      1. When a 1905 node has an unconfigured interface, it needs to send an
*         "M1" message. It does this by calling "wscBuildM1()", which takes the
*         name of the unconfigured interface and returns a data buffer that can
*         be directly embedded inside the WSC TLV/CMDU.
*         It also returns a "key" structure that will later be need to process
*         the response.
*
*      2. When the response ("M2") is received, the enrollee calls
*        "wscProcessM2()", which configures the interface and frees the "M1"
*        and "key" buffers previously allocated in "wscBuildM1()"
*
*    * REGISTRAR:
*
*      1. When a 1905 node recieves an "M1" message, it calls "wscBuildM2()",
*         which takes the contents of the "M1" message and returns a data buffer
*         that can be directly embedded inside the WSC response TLV/CMDU.
*
*      2. After sending the TLV/CMDU, the "M2" buffer must be freed with a call
*         to "wscFreeM2()"
*
*  Note that, in the enrolle, "M1" is automatically freed by "wscProcessM2()",
*  while, in the registrar, "M2" needs to be freed with "wscFreeM2()".
*
*  When receiving a WSC TLV, because its contents are opaque to the 1905 node,
*  function "wscGetType()" can be used do distinguish between "M1" and "M2".
*
*  With all of this said, this is how you would use this API in the 1905 code:
*
*    - When receiving a AP search response (ie. when we want to configure an
*      unconfigured AP interface and a registrar has been found):
*
*        uint8_t  *m1;
*        uint16_t  m1_size;
*        void     *key;
*
*        wscBuildM1("wlan0", &m1, &m1_size, &key);
*        <send TVL/CMDU containing "m1">
*        <save "m1"/"m1_size"/"key" somehow, associated to "wlan0">
*
*
*    - When receiving a WSC CMDU:
*
*        if (WSC_TYPE_M1 == wscGetType(m, m_size))
*        {
*          *  Registrar
*
*          uint8_t  *m2;
*          uint16_t  m2_size;
*
*          wscBuildM2(m, m_size, &m2, &m2_size);
*          <send TLV/CMDU containing "m2">
*          wscFreeM2(m2, m2_size);
*        }
*        else
*        {
*          *  Enrollee
*
*          <retrieve "m1"/"m1_size"/"key", associated to "wlan0">
*          wscProcessM2(key, m1, m1_size, m, m_size);
*        }
*
*  Note that the references to "M1" and "key" must be "saved" for later use,
*  once the response is received.
*  For convenience, "wscProcessM2()" also accepts "NULL" as the 'M1'
*  arguments meaning "the last built M and its key"
*  However, if you use this shortcut, make sure you never call "wscBuildM1()"
*  more than once in a row (without calling "wscProcessM2()" in between), or
*  else the first "M1" will be lost forever.
*
*  By the way, all the next functions return "0" if there a problem an "1"
*  otherwise (except for "wscGetType()", which returns the message type)
